There are plently of adventures to be had in the realm of carrot simulation. Up ahead you notice two doors. The door closer to the east side of the room has a sign that says 'Turnip Door'. The door closer to the west side of the room has a picture of a carrot on it.[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]This is where you must put all your training to the test, which door do you choose?</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Fake Turnip Room]</span></p><p class="indent0">The blank is a room. The Turnip Door is west of the blank and east of the Simulation Start. The Turnip door is a door. The turnip door is closed and locked. The description of the Turnip Door is &quot;<span class="quote">Sounds like they are having a party in there...</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of opening the turnip door, say &quot;<span class="quote">This is Carrot Simulator.

Also you are a carrot and don't have hands. Oh well, it would be silly to go back anyway.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">stop the action.</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Underground Room]</span></p><p class="indent0">Undergound is a room. The description of Underground is &quot;<span class="quote">After rolling through the door you find yourself underground. It is very hard to see and the dirt is making is hard to move.</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0">The Carrot Door is east of Underground and west of the Simulation Start. The Carrot door is a door. The carrot door is closed and openable. The description of the carrot door is &quot;<span class="quote">A simple wooden door with a picture of a carrot on it. As a fellow carrot enthusiast, you have a slight platonic attraction to this door.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Things that are in the Underground Room]</span></p><p class="indent0">Water is in the Underground. The description of water is &quot;<span class="quote">A liquidy substance that provides life to all the organisms on this planet. The water could probably benefit something.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Roots is in the Underground. Roots is a container that is open. The description of roots is &quot;<span class="quote">That is the strangest container you have ever seen! The roots look dry and crusty. As a carrot, you can relate to dry and crusty roots.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Fiber is in the Roots. The description of fiber is &quot;<span class="quote">Very important to carrots. The current strength of this fiber is [</span><span class="substitution">fiber strength</span><span class="quote">] fiber units.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Fiber Strength is number that varies.

This is a lot better than being cramped underground.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Items on the Surface]</span></p><p class="indent0">Cotton Candy is in the Surface. The description of Cotton Candy is &quot;<span class="quote">Fluffy pink cotton candy. It reminds you of the war.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Carrot Friends is a person in the Surface. The description of Carrot Friends is &quot;<span class="quote">Oh hey look! A bunch of your friends are here, you should try going over and speak to them.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Carrot-cature is in the Surface. The description of Carrot-cature is &quot;<span class="quote">The Carrot-cature is a goofy picture of a carrot. The carrot in the picture is wearing a pair of sun glasses; however, you cannot tell who it is because all carrots look the same.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Carrot Container is in the Surface. The Carrot Container is a container that is closed and openable. The description of the Carrot Container is &quot;<span class="quote">You never thought you would be as happy as you are now. The Carrot Container is the fabled last resting place of all carrots. It is the last thing carrots see before they are taken to the world beyond. But you can't seem to remember the whole tale. You recall something about needing strong fiber to be placed in the container.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Some Variable Stuff]</span></p><p class="indent0">cotton_touch is a number that varies. cotton_touch is 0.</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Taking Check]</span></p><p class="indent0">Before taking Cotton Candy:</p><p class="indent1">If cotton_touch is 0:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">I would be wary about approaching the cotton candy.

How can something so sweet be bad anyway. You summon your carrot strength to roll towards the cotton candy. You end up rolling right into its pink, sugary clouds. You can smell the sweetness of the cotton candy. Distracted, you fail to notice the approaching footsteps of a child. Just as the shadow of the child passes over you, you realize the true reason of the Cotton Candy's evil. The candy itself is not the actual reason to fear it, carrots fear cotton candy because of what it attracts: evil children! It is too late, you hear the child shriek, 'COTTON CANDY and CARROTS?!' The child swiftly bends down to grab you. Using you as some kind of make shift cone, the child whirls the cotton candy around your carrot top. As you feel yourself being carried around, the child slowly and methodically begins eating the cotton candy. Soon, there is none left. The child is left with no other choise but to dispose of his makeshift cone. Piece by piece, crunch by crunch, you feel yourself getting ripped apart. Within seconds there is none of you left.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">stop the action.</p><p class="indent0">Before taking Carrot Friends:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You're a monster, why would you want to kidnap your friends?[</span><span class="substitution">line break</span><span class="quote">]Maybe speaking to them about their day would be better.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">stop the action.</p><p class="indent0">Before taking Carrot-cature:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Somone worked hard on that.
